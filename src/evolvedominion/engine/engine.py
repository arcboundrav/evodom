    Decisions are responsible for accomplishing [1]. Players are
    responsible for [2]. The engine handles [3].

    In a given context, the moves available to a player are derived

    During the Action Phase the prototypical instruction set defines a
    routine of playing an Action card and a routine which passes the
    phase. There is no free variable to bind in the second routine. It
    isa sequence of operations on state variables which is fully
    defined a priori and independent of player input.

    In contrast, the free variable to bind in the routine of playing an
    Action card is the identity of a card satisfying the constraints.
    The full set of possibilities is the union of O and A, where:
    O is the singleton set containing the routine for passing the Action
    Phase; and, A is a set where each element is the routine of playing
    an Action Card with its free variable bound to a functionally
